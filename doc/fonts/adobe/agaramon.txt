Using Adobe Garamond with LaTeX is supported through the 
macro package xagaramon.sty.  Loading the package

  \usepackage{xagaramon}

makes LaTeX use Adobe Garamond with normal digits as the
default roman font family, whereas

  \usepackage[osf]{xagaramon}
  
selects oldstyle digits.

|  Notice that Garamond is supported with T1 (european) and
|  TS1 (textcompanion) encoding only, so you should issue 
|  the commands
|
|    \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
|    \usepackage{textcomp}
|
|  in the document preamble.  The obsolete OT1 encoding,
|  which is still the default with LaTeX, is _not_
|  supported.



Optional scaling
----------------
Adobe Garamond looks smaller than other typefaces with the
same nominal size.  This may lead to problems as far as
blending with other fonts is concerned; furthermore, the
default line spacing of the LaTeX document classes may be
too large.  Loading the package xagaramon with the option

  [scaled=...]

causes Garamond to be scaled as indicated, for instance

  \usepackage[scaled=1.04]{xagaramon}
  
will enlarge the font size by 4 percent.  When the keyword
"scaled" is spacified alone, i.e.

  \usepackage[scaled]{xagaramon}

a scale of 1.05 is assumed.  This goes well with many other
fonts and with the default line spacing of the LaTeX
document classes.



Math typesetting
----------------
Adobe Garamond can be used in conjunction with the Euler
math fonts, i.e., with the macro package eulervm.sty.  It is
recommended to enlarge Garamond by 5% as explained above.
See the documenattion of the package eulervm.sty for further
information!



Kerning data
------------
The kerning tables supplied by Adobe are suitable for the
English language only.  They do not cover accented letters,
and they do not take care of typical letter pairs in
non-English languages.  With the present set of TeX metrics
I have -- to my best knowledge -- enhanced the kerning
tables to fix at least the most severe deficiencies for the
German language.



NFSS classification of the text fonts
-------------------------------------

  encoding(s)  family  series  shape(s) 
  --------------------------------------
  T1, TS1      padx    m       n, sc, it
  T1, TS1      padx    sb      n, sc, it
  T1, TS1      padx    b       n, sc, it
  T1, TS1      padj    m       n, sc, it
  T1, TS1      padj    sb      n, sc, it
  T1, TS1      padj    b       n, sc, it
  
Notice that the series m and sb comprise real smallcaps, 
whereas the bold smallcaps are "faked".

Only those text companion (TS1) symbols, that are also part
of the ISO-Adobe character set, plus the Euro symbol, are
available.
