               Using Adobe Minion with LaTeX

Within LaTeX, Adobe Minion with SmallCaps and true
oldstyle figures is mapped to the font families "pmnx" and
"pmnj".  "pmnx" comes with regular digits, whereas "pmnj"
has oldstyle digits as the default ones.  

  \renewcommand{\rmdefault}{pmnj}

makes LaTeX use Adobe Minion with oldstyle digits and true
smallcaps as the default roman font family, whereas

  \renewcommand{\rmdefault}{pmnx}
  
selects Minion with normal figures.

|  Notice that Minion is supported with T1 (european) and
|  TS1 (textcompanion) encoding only, so you should issue 
|  the commands
|
|    \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
|    \usepackage{textcomp}
|
|  in the document preamble.  The obsolete OT1 encoding,
|  which is still the default with LaTeX, is _not_
|  supported.


Minion Ornaments
----------------
The oranaments are mapped to the font family "pmn" and the
encoding "U", so they can be used through the command
\Pisymbol from the package pifont.sty.  The symbols are
accessaible at positions 97...119 of the font.  For
instance,

  \usepackage{pifont}
  ...
  \Pisymbol{pmn}{111}

gives the Aldus leaf.


Kerning data
------------
The kerning tables supplid by Adobe are suitable for the
English language only.  They do not cover accented letters,
and they do not take care of typical letter pairs in
non-English languages.  With the present set of TeX metrics
I have -- to my best knowledge -- enhanced the kerning
tables to fix the worst deficiencies for the German 
language.  


Suitable math fonts
-------------------
As to math typesetting, there are two alternatives:

(1)
Use the free Euler fonts through the package eulervm.sty:

  \renewcommand{\rmdefault}{pmnx}
  \usepackage[small]{eulervm}

These fonts exhibit excellent typographical quality, 
but their appearance is somewhat uncommon.  
The Euler fonts, the package eulervm.sty and the related VFs
are part of almost any decent LaTeX distribution.

(2)
Use the commercial MathTime and MathTime Plus fonts through
the package mathpmnt and the related virtual fonts.  The
packages takes care of redefining both \rmdefault and the
math fonts:

  \usepackage{mathpmnt}
  
This package and the virtual fonts are distributed in
conjunction with the support files for the Minion text
fonts.  See the file texmf/doc/latex/mathpmnt/mathpmnt.pdf
for a detailed documentation



NFSS classification of the text fonts
-------------------------------------

  encoding(s)  family  series  shape(s) 
  ----------------------------------------------------------
  T1, TS1      pmnx    m       n, sc, it, scit
  T1, TS1      pmnx    sb      n, sc, it, scit
  T1, TS1      pmnx    b       n, sc, it
  T1, TS1      pmnj    m       n, sc, it, scit
  T1, TS1      pmnj    sb      n, sc, it, scit
  T1, TS1      pmnj    b       n, sc, it
  U            pmn     m       n          (Minion Ornaments)

Notice that the series m and sb comprise real smallcaps, 
whereas the bold smallcaps are "faked".

Only those text companion (TS1) symbols, that are also part
of the ISO-Adobe character set, are available, plus the Euro
symbol (which is actually faked).
