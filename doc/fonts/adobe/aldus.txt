Within LaTeX, the Adobe Aldus font family caries the names
"pasx" and "pasj".  "pasx" provides regular digits, whereas
"pasj" has oldstyle digits as the default ones.  For
instance, the command

  \renewcommand{\rmdefault}{pasj}

makes LaTeX use Adobe Aldus with oldstyle digits as the
default roman font family.  Note that Aldus does not include
any bold fonts!

|  Notice that Aldus is supported with T1 (european) and
|  TS1 (textcompanion) encoding only, so you should issue
|  the commands
|
|    \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
|    \usepackage{textcomp}
|
|  in the document preamble.  The obsolete OT1 encoding,
|  which is still the default with LaTeX, is _not_
|  supported.


As to math typesetting, it is recommended to use the 
Euler fonts through the package eulervm.sty, which should be
loaded with the option "small":

  \renewcommand{\rmdefault}{pasx}
  \usepackage[small]{eulervm}

Or, if you prefer oldstyle digits in text mode:

  \renewcommand{\rmdefault}{pasj}
  \usepackage[small,euler-digits]{eulervm}


NFSS classification of the text fonts
-------------------------------------

  family  series  shape(s)  
  -------------------------
  pasx    m       n, it, sc
  pasj    m       n, it, sc

Available encodings are T1 (European) and TS1 (Text
Companion).  The obsolete OT1 encoding is not supported.
The TS1 encoding comprises only those symbols, that are also
part of the ISO-Adobe character set.  Notice that there is
no Euro symbol.
